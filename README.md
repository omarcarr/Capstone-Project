# Capstone Project - Who Is The Greatest of All Time NBA Player

## The Big Finale!!!!!!  How 12 Weeks Of Data Science Changed Me.....
**********************************************************************************************************************************


## This has been the culmination of 12 Weeks of possibly one of the toughest courses I've ever had, and I graduated with a Mathematics degree.  When I stepped into the class, I had no idea to expect.  The most I knew was that there would be a decent amount of math knowledge needed.  Most of it would be command line and use of a language that I never heard of.

## Day 1, I had no clue what pandas were except for the bears that love bamboo trees.  After 12 weeks, I can tell you about Natural Language Processing, Unsupervised Learning, and just how to possibly predict stock price trends over a period of time.  Truly, I can say that the General Assembly Data Science Immersive class has placed me into a world of Data Science that I love being in.

## This particular project involves a particular debate for those who follow sports.  If you are an NBA fan, you have discussed who is the best NBA player of all time.  Those who watched in the 60's would say Wilt Chamberlain or Bill Russell.  The fans that grew up in the 70's would say Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  The 80's babies would claim Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, or Michael Jordan.  The era of the 1990's would probably say that Lebron James is the one and only GOAT.  The new kids on the block only know of the Golden State Warriors dominance and would probably mention Stephen Curry or Kevin Durant.  With the many techniques of machine learning and data scraping, this project will have predicted who the Most Valuable of Players truly is and at least offer another look into an age old debate.

## The "GOAT Talk" project consists of a Technical Report that details the many methods and tactics used, numerous Jupyter Notebooks with code worked out, and .csv files saved from the data scraping tactics used for obtaining statistics.
